## Design Document

**Document Information:**

## 1. Executive Summary

The MySQL federated storage engine currently maintains complete result sets in memory for all queries, leading to excessive memory consumption and scalability limitations. Through comprehensive analysis of 42 real-world SQL statements and deep code investigation, we identified that only 42.9% of operations require row positioning capabilities, while 0% require complex continuation patterns on federated tables.

This design proposes a selective result set preservation optimization that maintains positioning data only when required by the MySQL server, implementing time-based cleanup mechanisms to manage memory efficiently. The solution focuses on Phase 1-2 implementation with immediate memory gains and measurable performance improvements.

The optimization will reduce memory consumption by approximately 57% for non-positioning queries while maintaining full compatibility with existing federated engine functionality and MySQL's storage engine interface requirements.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Issues

**Excessive Memory Usage:** The federated engine currently stores complete result sets (`MYSQL_RES`) in memory for all queries, regardless of whether positioning is required. This approach:
- Consumes unnecessary memory for 57.1% of queries that never call `position()` or `rnd_pos()`
- Limits scalability for large result sets
- Wastes network bandwidth maintaining data that may never be accessed again

**No Result Set Lifecycle Management:** Current implementation lacks mechanisms to:
- Clean up result sets that are no longer needed
- Differentiate between positioning-required and streaming-only queries
- Manage memory pressure during concurrent operations

**Performance Impact:** Large result sets cause:
- Increased memory fragmentation
- Higher garbage collection overhead in client connections
- Potential connection timeouts for very large datasets

### Root Cause Analysis

Based on our comprehensive code analysis in `position_rnd_pos_analysis.md`, the core issue stems from the federated engine's conservative approach of preserving all result data. The engine was designed assuming all queries might require positioning, but real-world analysis shows this assumption is incorrect for the majority of use cases.

## 3. Current System Analysis

### Key Findings from Code Investigation

**Positioning Patterns Identified:**
- **Pattern 1:** Filesort with row references (Line 986 in `sql/filesort.cc`)
- **Pattern 2:** Window function frame navigation (operates on temp tables only)
- **Pattern 3:** Multi-table UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **Pattern 4:** Range optimization with index operations
- **Pattern 5:** Semi-join duplicate elimination
- **Pattern 6:** Recursive CTE processing (temp tables only)

**Critical Discovery:** Window functions and recursive CTEs operate exclusively on temporary tables (`sql/sql_tmp_table.cc:2941`), not on federated tables, dramatically simplifying requirements.

**Real-World Query Analysis (42 Statements):**
- **18 queries (42.9%)** require positioning: Complex JOINs, UPDATEs, analytics
- **24 queries (57.1%)** are streaming-only: Simple SELECTs, aggregations, INSERTs
- **0 queries** require rnd_pos() → rnd_next() continuation on federated tables

### Current Implementation Review

**Federated Engine Architecture (`storage/federated/ha_federated.cc:2568-2584`):**
```cpp
// Current implementation preserves full result set
stored_result = mysql_store_result(mysql);
mysql_data_seek(stored_result, position);  // Positioning support
```

**Memory Usage Characteristics:**
- Full result set buffering for all queries
- Position data stored as row offsets in `MYSQL_RES`
- No automatic cleanup until table close
- Memory consumption scales linearly with result set size

---

## 4. Solution Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Selective Preservation:** Only maintain result sets when `position()` is called
2. **Lazy Cleanup:** Implement time-based cleanup rather than complex memory management
3. **Zero Regression:** Maintain full compatibility with existing MySQL functionality
4. **Measurable Impact:** Target 57% memory reduction for non-positioning queries
5. **Simple Implementation:** Avoid complex spill-to-disk or LRU mechanisms

## 6. Technical Specifications

### API Changes

**Modified Methods in `ha_federated` class:**

```cpp
class ha_federated : public handler {
private:
  bool needs_full_result_set;           // New: Positioning requirement flag
  time_t last_access_time;             // New: Cleanup tracking
  
public:
  // Modified: Lazy result set allocation
  int rnd_next(uchar *buf) override;
  
  // Modified: Set positioning flag
  void position(const uchar *record) override;
  
  // Modified: Check positioning requirement
  int rnd_pos(uchar *buf, uchar *pos) override;
  
  // New: Cleanup management
  void cleanup_result_set_if_needed();
  bool should_preserve_result_set();
};
```

**New System Variables:**

```sql
-- Result set cache timeout (seconds, default: 1800)
SET federated_result_cache_timeout = 1800;

-- Enable/disable optimization (default: ON)  
SET federated_selective_caching = ON;
```

### Memory Management Algorithm

**Decision Flow:**
1. **Query Start:** Initialize with streaming mode (`needs_full_result_set = false`)
2. **During Execution:** 
   - If `position()` called → Switch to full result set mode
   - If streaming only → Continue with minimal memory usage
3. **Cleanup Trigger:** Time-based or explicit cleanup
4. **Memory Release:** Immediate for streaming, delayed for positioning

**State Transitions:**
```
STREAMING_ONLY ──position()──> FULL_RESULT_SET
     │                              │
     │                              │
  timeout                       timeout  
     │                              │
     ▼                              ▼
  CLEANUP ◄──────────────────────► CLEANUP
```
